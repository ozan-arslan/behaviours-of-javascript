This repository includes examples of strange and deviant behaviours in JavaScript.  
If I were to grasp the word "language", which I am from now on. I would treat every language with a similar approach.  
I will note down the unique aspects of this language in this repository during my learning journey.  
In other terms, there will be a lot of 'went,' 'brought,' 'built,' 'sent,' and 'wore' in this repository.
